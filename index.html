    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
     <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>techincal sophistication</em>,the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from <strong>command line</strong> and coding to guessing
      keyboard shortcuts,
      Goggling error messages, and knowing when to reboot the computer. To join

     <p>
      HTML was created by the original "web developer," computer scientist
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Time Berners-Lee</a>.
      It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat,
      but it would be cool if it were.

      When he is not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces
      , doing front-end development, or writting some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

     <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel,
      Conan, or The Ellen Show,but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart.
      He's just as happy shredding well-spe'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
